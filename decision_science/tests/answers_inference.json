    "P_VALUE": "when the p-value is less than 0.05 we say that the null hypothesis\nwas succesfully rejected and that the alternative hypothesis can be taken \nin practice this tells us how confident are we of our coefficients, in our case 0.128>0.05 means we are not confident with a 95%\n\nneather for a 90%, we can take it however for 87% confidence level.\n",
